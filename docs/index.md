# <center>General Info</center>

### **Who we are**
We are a startup that launched earlier this year with the goal of enabling Creators to monetize by offering paid experiences and other engagements to their Fans.
We empower Creators to build their own revenue, so they're not solely reliant on brands, sponsorships, or donations. 

### **What we do**
Every day we are working to improve our site and increase our features. We have some exciting stuff coming, but as of now, our site allows Creaters to list their creations/content for sale directly to their Fans and Followers. You can sell whatever paid experiences you want (no explicit content though!) for whatever price you want.  

Fans can buy paid experiences from Creators like Play a 1v1 game together, Participate in a rap battle contest, Paint and mail a custom painting, Meet for a step-by step tutorial, Sponsor 3 hours of a live novelty game playthrough, etc. We encourage you to get creative!  

We even allow you to add you availability and Fan prerequisites for experiences that require your live presence so that you can skip all the back-and-forth coordination.

### **How we're different**
Our platform does not limit the types of experiences or tangible deliverables that you can sell. You make your own rules. Everything is a one-time purchase, no subscriptions.  

Setting up your store is super easy and self-explanatory. 

For experiences that require live interactions, we have built in your calendar availability so that Fans can only book you during your pre-approved times.

### **How it works**
Because we just launched and are ramping up, our Creator sign-up process is currently by invitation-only. 

1. Use the credentials we email you to sign up. 
2. You'll notice that we've pre-populated some suggested experiences for you. You are more than welcome to enact them as they are, but we recommend that you take the time to craft and list experiences (and prices) that are a good fit for you and your Fans. You know better than us what your Fans would be willing to pay for.
3. Set up your Stripe credentials - this is how you get paid! To ensure maximum safety, we do not handle any payment information. We use Stripe for payment processing. You can read more about Stripe security here. 
4. Once your paid experiences are up, we encourage you to share your Creatorfy page with your audience similarly to how you share your socials. Link it wherever you think your Fans will have visibility to it.
